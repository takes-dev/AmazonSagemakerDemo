    "## Background\n",
    "Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers. Because resources and a customer's attention are limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer. Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an example problem to predict if a customer will enroll for a term deposit at a bank after one or more phone calls. The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preparing your Amazon SageMaker notebook\n",
    "* Downloading data from the internet into Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "* Investigating and transforming the data so that it can be fed to Amazon SageMaker algorithms\n",
    "* Estimating a model \n",
    "* Evaluating the effectiveness of the model\n",
    "* Setting the model up to make ongoing predictions\n",

    "_This notebook was created and tested on an ml.m4.xlarge notebook instance._\n",

    "\n",
    "- The Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and prefix that you want to use for training and model data. This should be within the same Region as the Notebook Instance, training, and hosting.\n",
    "- The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for how to create these. \n",
